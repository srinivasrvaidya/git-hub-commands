Steps explained a bit:

1. Clone your fork repository on your PC. 

2. Go in newly created folder that contains your copy of repository so that next git commands will work

3. Add a "remote" named upstream (name doesn't matter) that points to ezsystems/ezpublish repo

4. Fetch all missing comits from the remote repo and merge them into your local branch (master)

5. Push all new commits that where got from upstream into your fork

That's all, comments are welcomed.

Q) how to delete file/folder from your github repo ?

You could checkout 'master' with both directories;

$git rm -r one-of-the-directories
$git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
$git push origin master

As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)

In that case use:

$git rm -r --cached myFolder

$ git remote rm upstream
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Foo/repos.git
